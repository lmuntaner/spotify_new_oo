# Spotify Searcher and Player

This is a small project to test new Object Oriented Design Patterns.

It uses factory functions that I saw on [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImwrezYhw4w)
youtube video by Mattias Petter Johansson.

You can download, open a server and go to the root. The features is just
that you can search for an artist. Then pick an artist to check his/her albums.
Pick an album and select one of the tracks to hear the preview.

There are still some refactor to do since I am using some components that share
a lot of funcionality. I will try to use extension of the objects rather than
typical class inheritance.
